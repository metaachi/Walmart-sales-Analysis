# Walmart-sales-Analysis

About 
The objective of this project is to analyze Walmart sales data to gain insights into consumer behavior, product and branch performance, and sales trends. By examining sales patterns, the aim is to identify opportunities for optimizing and enhancing sales strategies. The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the [Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting).

The dataset contains historical sales data from 45 Walmart locations across different regions. The goal is to forecast sales for every department within each store, with multiple departments in each location. Additionally, the dataset includes information on Christmas markdowns, which are known to impact sales. However, accurately forecasting the effects of these markdowns on specific departments poses a significant challenge.
